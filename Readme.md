Writing language models in keras. Similar idea as [keras-vision](https://github.com/veb-101/keras-vision)

This repo is at the moment is not for creating something like llama.cpp or ollama, it's just for my self learning.

The goal is to motivate myself to read more papers and write more code focused on deep learning and engineering perpective.

I got tired of waiting.
